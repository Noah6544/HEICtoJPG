**Convert your HEIC files to JPG easily!**

I made this and used it in some projects but quickly converted it into a script for future use!


⚠️ Just make sure  your folder with your HEIC images only has HEIC images and nothing else! Then you should be good!

ToDo: 
- Create Pyinstaller executable because if you go on a new device, installing ImageMagick is excessive! ~~(just got a new laptop for college and had to figure out how to get wand to work)~~
